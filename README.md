# selenide-study
An exploration of Selenide, A Selenium Based Java Tool

## Motivation

Artists will sometimes create a [_study_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Study_(art)) before completing a full art piece. This is a smaller scale version of what the artist wants to do to explore the form they're going for.

Here, I'm following the same kind of idea. I'm creating a study of [Selenide](https://selenide.org/), a test framework built on top of Selenium with nicer syntax and semantics for browser automation. I'm looking at different aspects of Selenide and how it works with common browser automation patterns in Java with Junit.

What this project *isn't*:

- a tutorial on how to use Selenide, Java and/or Junit,
- a "best practices" style repo of how to use Selenide for browser automation,
- a production-use test framework, or
- recommended examples of how to use Selenide. 

This is more of samples demonstrating how Selenide might work in situations and what those situations might look like that are of interest to me (and probably other test developers). 

Enjoy!
